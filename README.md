6006CEM Machine Learning and Related Applications: A Machine Learning Approach 

This GitHub repository presents a machine learning project focused on predicting the Ultraviolet (UV) index in Portugal and Spain, regions known for high sun irradiation levels. The project's core objective is to develop accurate UV index forecasts using historical meteorological data, contributing to better public health guidelines. It encompasses a detailed analysis of various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR), applied to meteorological data from 2008 to 2020.

Key components of the repository include:

Data Analysis: Merging, cleaning, and visualizing meteorological data.

Model Development: Implementation and tuning of machine learning models.

Evaluation: Performance assessment using metrics like RMSE and MAE.

Documentation: Detailed explanations of methodologies and results.
